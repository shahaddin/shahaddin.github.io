Graduation
======
After three and a half years of studying, I can gladly say that I have graduated from the University of South Florida with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. The commencement ceremony was wonderful, and it truly is one of the events that you know you will remember for the rest of your life.

Plans for the Future
======
As great as my graduation was, I still feel like it wasn't the final bell on education but a more transitional one. Now that I have my Bachelor's Degree, I can look further up the ladder of education, perhaps the pinnacle: a PhD. My current plan for the future is to pursue my doctorate in Computer Science(and get the Master's along the way). I am currently aiming for research in the areas of Computer Vision and Robotics. I believe these highly intertwined fields will be the leading fields of the future, physically and digitally. And more importantly, I feel enthusiastic and eager to get my doctorate in research focused in this area. You can never know what tomorrow might bring, but when tomorrow comes, I will be waiting for that.
