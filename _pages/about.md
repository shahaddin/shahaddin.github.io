## Professional Experience 

My first experience in software development started in high school when I landed an internship at AzeriMed LLC, one of Azerbaijan's biggest pharmaceutical companies. This opportunity is most notably thanks to my early-life interest in programming, which ultimately led to getting a bronze medal at the National Informatics Olympiad of Azerbaijan which has also effectively granted me a full-ride scholarship to any public university in Azerbaijan in the Computer Science field. At AzeriMed, I had the opportunity to work on AptekOnline, Azerbaijan's first online pharmaceutical database for commercial purposes, which has granted me a solid understanding of how database systems work and how servers operate.

A few years after my experience there, and after moving to the United States, I started looking for more experience in software. At the time I was a sophomore at USF, I joined Byte Cave, a startup working on connecting students with respective schools/teachers remotely. There, I worked as a Full Stack Developer and learned relevant tools of the field: by utilizing tools such as Angular for front-end with HTML/CSS and Typescript. On the back end, I was mainly working on making sure the database on the backend matched the updates coming from the front end, using SQL and C#(.NET).

## Academic Experience

My junior year at USF has been a pivotal step in my life, as my interest was getting more and more shifted into Academia. In the Fall of my junior year, I took the "Introduction to Robotics" course, which has further kindled my interest in Robotics and Computer Vision. After finishing the course, and a discussion with my professor, Dr. Sun I became a lab member in his research. There, I learned many aspects of academia and gained hands-on experience in Academia, which made me sure that what I want after my Bachelor's Degree will be a higher degree of education.

At Dr. Sun's Lab, RPAL, the first research paper I worked on was a research paper on Benchmarking for Multi-Object Grasping (MOG). The paper has been currently submitted to the RA-L journal for review, and we are expecting feedback soon. My role in this paper was exploring alternative grasping devices and methods, and helping with human experiments. The last work, I have partaken in at Dr. Sun's Lab before my graduation was on Multi-Object Grasping from the surface of a pile using Computer Vision. Premise being able to see possible implications of MOG using Computer Vision and how it compares to the conventional MOG grasping method using tactile sensors in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

## Projects

I would highly advise checking some of the projects I have done throughout the years(Excluding my research work as the paper is not public yet). All projects are publicly available on [**Github**](https://github.com/shahaddin) spanning many different areas: Software Development, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Operating Systems.
